# MarginFuel Add User Page

## Skills Utilized
- JavaScript
- HTML
- CSS
- VUE JS

## Project Description
This project is an add user page to a companies website. It contains a table filled with User Information and a button that would bring up a form for whoever was using the website to add another User. The table itself is sortable, searchable, and the number of records displayed on each page can be edited. I designed the whole page to match the styling of their website at the time.

## Inspiration For Project Creation
While studying abroad in New Zealand I had the opurtunity to participate in an internship with a company called MarginFuel. While there I was tasked with creating an Add User page for their website using Vue JS.
